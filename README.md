# NanoLog
Nanolog is an extremely performant nanosecond scale logging system for C++ that exposes a simple printf-like API and achieves over 80 *million* logs/second at a median latency of just over *7 nanoseconds*.

How it achieves this insane performance is by extracting static log information at compile-time, only logging the dynamic components in runtime hotpath, and deferring formatting to an offline process. This basically shifts work out of the runtime and into the compilation and post-execution phases.

More information about the techniques used in this logging system can be found in the [NanoLog Paper published in the 2018 USENIX Annual Technical Conference](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc18/presentation/yang-stephen).

## Performance

This section shows the performance of NanoLog with existing logging systems such as [spdlog v1.1.0](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog), [Log4j2 v2.8](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/), [Boost 1.55](http://www.boost.org), [glog v0.3.5](https://github.com/google/glog), and Windows Event Tracing with Windows Software Trace Preprocessor on Windows 10 [(WPP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/wpp-software-tracing).

### Throughput

Maximum throughput measured with 1 million messages logged back to back with no delay and 1-16 logging threads (NanoLog logged 100 million messages to generate a log file of comparable size). ETW is "Event Tracing for Windows." The log messages used can be found in the [Log Message Map below](#Log-Messages-Map).

### Runtime Latency
Measured in nanoseconds and each cell represents the 50th / 99.9th tail latencies. The log messages used can be found in the [Log Message Map below](#Log-Messages-Map).

# Using NanoLog

## Prerequisites
NanoLog depends on the following:
* C++17 Compiler: [GNU gcc 6.4.0](https://gcc.gnu.org) or greater
* [GNU Make 4.0](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) or greater
* [Python 2.7.9](https://www.python.org) or greater
* POSIX AIO and Threads (usually installed with Linux)

## NanoLog Pipeline
The NanoLog system enables low latency logging by deduplicating static log metadata and outputting the dynamic log data in a binary format. This means that log files produced by NanoLog are in binary and must be passed through a separate decompression program to produce the full, human readable ASCII log.

## Compiling NanoLog
There are two versions of NanoLog (Preprocessor version and C++17 version) and you must chose **one** to use with your application as they’re not interoperable. The biggest difference between the two is that the Preprocessor version requires one to integrate a Python script in their build chain while the C++17 version is closer to a regular library (simply build and link against it). The benefit of using the Preprocessor version is that it performs more work at compile-time, resulting in a slightly more optimized runtime.

If you don’t know which one to use, go with C++17 NanoLog as it’s easier to use.

### C++17 NanoLog
The C++17 version of NanoLog works like a traditional library; just [``#include "NanoLogCpp17.h"``](./runtime/NanoLogCpp17.h) and link against the NanoLog library. A sample application can be found in the [sample directory](./sample).

To build the C++17 NanoLog Runtime library, go in the [runtime directory](./runtime/) and invoke ```make```. This will produce ```./libNanoLog.a``` to against link your application and a ```./decompressor``` application that can be used to re-inflate the binary logs.

When you compile your application, be sure to include the NanoLog header directory ([``-I ./runtime``](./runtime/)), and link against NanoLog, pthreads, and POSIX AIO (``-L ./runtime/ -lNanoLog -lpthreads -lrt``). Sample g++ invocations can be found in the [sample GNUmakefile](./sample/GNUmakefile).

After you compile and run the application, the log file generated can then be passed to the ```./decompressor``` application to generate the full human-readable log file (instructions below).

### Preprocessor NanoLog
The Preprocessor version of NanoLog requires a tighter integration with the user build chain and is only for advanced/extreme users.

It *requires* the user's GNUmakefile to include the [NanoLogMakeFrag](./NanoLogMakeFrag), declare USR_SRCS and USR_OBJS variables to list all app’s source and object files respectively, and use the pre-defined ```run-cxx``` macro to compile *ALL* the user .cc files into .o files instead of ``g++``. See the [preprocessor sample GNUmakefile](./sample_preprocessor/GNUmakefile) for more details.

Internally, the ```run-cxx``` invocation will run a Python script over the source files and generate library code that is *specific* to each compilation of the user application. In other words, the compilation builds a version of the NanoLog library that is __non-portable, even between compilations of the same application__ and each ```make``` invocation rebuilds this library.

Additionally, the compilation should also generate a ```./decompressor``` executable in the app directory and this can be used to reconstitute the full human-readable log file (instructions below).

## NanoLog API
To use the NanoLog system in the code, one just has to include the NanoLog header (either [NanoLogCpp17.h](./runtime/NanoLogCpp17.h) for C++17 NanoLog or [NanoLog.h](./runtime/NanoLog.h) for Preprocessor NanoLog) and invoke the ```NANO_LOG()``` function in a similar fashion to printf, with the exception of a log level before it. Example below:

```cpp
#include "NanoLogCpp17.h"
using namespace NanoLog::LogLevels;

int main() {
  NANO_LOG(NOTICE, "Hello World! This is an integer %d and a double %lf\r\n", 1, 2.0);
  return 0;
}
```

Valid log levels are DEBUG, NOTICE, WARNING, and ERROR and the logging level can be set via ```NanoLog::setLogLevel(...)```

The rest of the NanoLog API is documented in the [NanoLog.h](./runtime/NanoLog.h) header file.

## Post-Execution Log Decompressor
The execution of the user application should generate a compressed, binary log file (default locations: ./compressedLog or /tmp/logFile). To make the log file human-readable, simply invoke the ```decompressor``` application with the log file.

```
./decompressor decompress ./compressedLog
```

After building the NanoLog library, the decompressor executable can be found in either the [./runtime directory](./runtime/) (for C++17 NanoLog) or the user app directory (for Preprocessor NanoLog).
